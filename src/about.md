I've been making software on the internet since 1996. I sometimes make photographs, and less often make music. Building software for creators has driven most of my work. Since 2015 I've focused on tools that change the way we create, manage, and share photography.

### A brief history of work

I started developing interactive CD-ROMs using Director around 1996. In the early 2000s I developed Flash games and became involved with CSS standards-based web design. In 2006 I worked with Adaptive Path on a blog analytics tool called Measure Map. That team was acquired by Google and redesigned Google Analytics. In 2008 I worked briefly at Twitter to create its first live streaming experience. In 2009 I co-founded the web-font platform Typekit. In 2012, Typekit was acquired by Adobe. At Adobe I worked across the (then new) Creative Cloud to expand Typekit from web fonts to desktop fonts (now Adobe Fonts). In 2015 I became VSCO's head of product. In 2019 I returned to my roots as an interactive software developer and released the iOS app [Series](https://www.seriesphotos.app).
