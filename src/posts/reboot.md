A new chapter means a new website. 

To get started, I've reduced to the essentials. Previous versions were hand-coded with a custom CMS. This time I've opted for [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) with the plan to make this more of a conversational home than a static site. Photos will return soon, again with more frequent updates. Its been too long since I felt like sharing that work on social media was an appropriate outlet.

But what's the new chapter? Hold tight, I'll have more to say about that soon.
