__Announcement__ — I've formed [Latent Co.](https://latentco.co) with [Naz Hamid](https://nazhamid.com) and [Juan Pablo Zambrano](https://jpzambrano.co). We're building a new product for Mac. A love letter to the creative tools that we grew up with; the kind that inspired us to create.

It's been quite a journey to get to this point; years of learning and exploration of the technical and user experience challenges of this product space. But after 10 years of working on photo tools, it felt like time to do something _big_.
