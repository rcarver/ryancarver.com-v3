  - title: "Latent Co. is forming"
    content: "I've formed Latent Co. with Naz Hamid and Juan Pablo Zambrano. We're building a new product for Mac; a love letter to the creative tools that we grew up with, the kind that inspired us to create."
  - title: "Reboot"
    content: "A new chapter means a new website. For now I've reduced it to the essentials. Previous versions were hand-coded with a custom CMS. This time, I've opted for 11ty on Netlify. I'm hoping this lends to more of a conversational home than a static site. Photos will return soon, again with more frequent updates. Its been too long since I felt like sharing that work on social media was an appropriate outlet."
